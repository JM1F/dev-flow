Welcome to DevFlow, a lightweight application designed to enhance software development productivity and workflow.

## Key Features

1. **Workspaces**: Create multiple workspaces to store and organise information for projects, ideas, applications, and documentation.

2. **Markdown Support**: Utilise Markdown syntax to write rich content, which is then transformed into formatted pages with options to save, print, and take screenshots.

3. **File Management**: Add, remove, and manage files within your workspaces to keep resources organised and easily accessible.

4. **Import and Export**: Effortlessly import workspaces from others or export yours to share or back up your data.

5. **Favourites**: Mark your most important or frequently used workspaces as favourites for quick access.

6. **Rename and Delete**: Keep your workspaces up to date by renaming them or delete those you no longer need.

7. **Drag-and-Drop Kanban Board**: Manage tasks with a fully interactive Kanban board where you can add, delete, edit, and move tasks across different stages of your workflow.

8. **Code Sandbox**: Access a robust coding environment supporting over 60 programming languages, featuring syntax highlighting, auto code-completion, and IntelliSense.

## Getting Started

1. **Launch DevFlow**: Start by creating your first workspace with the "New Workspace" button.

2. **Organise Your Workspace**: Name your workspace, and begin adding content with the Markdown editor or code snippets in the code sandbox.

3. **Task Management**: Utilise the Kanban board to manage tasks by adding new cards, moving them across columns, or editing existing ones.

4. **File Operations**: Use the file explorer to add, remove, or manage files.

5. **Workspace Customisation**: Set a workspace as a favourite or rename it as needed.

6. **Sharing and Collaboration**: Export your workspace to collaborate with others or import content to enhance your workspace.
